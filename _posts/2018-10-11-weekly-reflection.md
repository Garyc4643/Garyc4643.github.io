This week i did a project about a flag that we had to physicalluy and digitaly.I chose the ireland flag since it was very easy and basic.The project was overall easy since the code for making a rectangle was in a website mr.allata gave us.In addition a hard part was putting the colors on the side because the frist time i tried i put the whole rectangle green but i just wanted a part but i struggle but thanks to a classmate i found out how to so yeah if i was alone i probably would have failed.
